## Todo:

- [ ] Building panel (building and road blocks)
- [ ] Simple path finding
- [ ] Simple AI agents
- [ ] Camera controls

## Path finding:

1. Grid based A*



2. Node based Dijkstra's

Would require me to convert the grid into nodes connected by edges of distance.

## Blocks:

- Road
- Block

## Controls:

- 'b' - rotate block types
- 'a' - Add a single randomply placed SimpleAgent

## Audio

Menu music - screensavers theme (have it on SSD)



## Fuck it, let's make it a multiplayer thing. TURF WARS!!!

Simple. Multiplayer. Players take over buildings. That's it.
So how do players generate cash? Then each building generates some income? Start with that. Too passive, or too simple.
Each building means soldiers. Each building takes a certain number of soldiers to take over?
Players can send soldiers to take over buildings and colour them their color.
Bonus money for sectors.

Map is generated based on grid and sectors to start with.

Do I want a random element? I do, but it can't feel unfair. Player still has to be able to win the game
based on their skill.
